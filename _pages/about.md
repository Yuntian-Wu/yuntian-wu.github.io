I'm Yuntian Wu, a master's student at New York University specializing in Applied Urban Science and Informatics. My academic journey began at Simon Fraser University, where I completed a Bachelor of Science in Data Science, equipping me with a solid foundation for my current studies.

My passion for technology is also evident in my project work. At Simon Fraser University, I led the development of a 2D arcade game, 'Demon Tower', where I utilized my Java and OOP skills and demonstrated my leadership capabilities. Additionally, I've applied my data science skills to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on BC ferry employees, showcasing my ability to translate data into real-world insights.

Professionally, I've served as the Director of Data Analytics at Lightsoft Technologies, where I played a key role in deriving insights to enhance customer experiences. My prior roles as a Full-Stack Developer at ScholarNet Inc and a Data Analyst at Zhejiang Ruihong Chemical Ltd & TotalEnergies have further refined my skills in areas like predictive analytics, cloud computing, and full-stack development.

My technical toolkit includes JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, React, Angular, Node.js, Docker, and R-Studio. Being fluent in English and native in Chinese, I can communicate effectively in diverse settings.

I am deeply passionate about AI, Deep Learning, and Large Language Models. My journey is marked by a continuous pursuit of knowledge and practical application, making me well-suited for roles that demand technical expertise combined with real-world applicability, particularly in urban science and informatics.
